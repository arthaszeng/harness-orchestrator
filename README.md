AI coding tools excel at single-shot tasks. Continuous development needs more: goal tracking, quality gates, adversarial review, and audit trails. Harness organizes these into a contract-driven engineering loop that runs **inside your Cursor IDE** — no separate orchestrator process, no complex setup. For CI/CD and headless automation, an optional [orchestrator mode](#advanced-cross-client-orchestrator-mode) drives Cursor and Codex agents via external CLI.

## Quick Start (Cursor-native, 3 minutes)

### 1. Install harness

```bash
pip install harness-orchestrator
harness --version   # verify (also works: python3 -m harness --version)
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative: install from source (for contributors)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arthaszeng/harness-orchestrator.git
cd harness-orchestrator
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

</details>

### 2. Initialize your project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
harness init
```

The wizard walks you through setup. When asked for **Workflow Mode**, choose **cursor-native**:

```
Step 5/9  Workflow Mode
  Choose how harness drives development:
  1. orchestrator -- External CLI process drives cursor-agent (default)
  2. cursor-native -- Skills + subagents inside Cursor IDE (no external process)
  Choose [2]: 2
  → cursor-native mode: will generate skills, subagents, and rules
```

This generates skills, subagents, and rules directly into your `.cursor/` directory.

### 3. Use it in Cursor

Open your project in Cursor. You now have **three primary entry points** that cover all task sizes — from vague ideas to specific requirements:

**Start here — three entry points for all task sizes:**

| Skill | When to use | What it does |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `/harness-brainstorm` | "I have an idea" | Divergent exploration → vision → plan → review gate → auto build/eval/ship/retro |
| `/harness-vision` | "I have a direction" | Clarify vision → plan → review gate → auto build/eval/ship/retro |
| `/harness-plan` | "I have a requirement" | Refine plan + 5-role review → review gate → auto build/eval/ship/retro |

All three use recursive composition (brainstorm ⊃ vision ⊃ plan) and share the same plan review → ship pipeline. After plan approval, `/harness-ship` handles build → eval → iterate → ship → PR.

**Utility skills:**

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/harness-investigate` | Systematic bug investigation: reproduce → hypothesize → verify → minimal fix |
| `/harness-learn` | Memverse knowledge management: store, retrieve, update project learnings |
| `/harness-retro` | Engineering retrospective: commit analytics, hotspot detection, trend tracking |

**Advanced skills** (for granular control):

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/harness-build` | Implement the contract, run CI, triage failures, write a structured build log |
| `/harness-eval` | 5-role code review (architect + product-owner + engineer + qa + project-manager) |
| `/harness-ship` | Full pipeline: test → review → fix → commit → push → PR |
| `/harness-doc-release` | Documentation sync: detect stale docs after code changes |

**Try it now** — open Cursor chat and type:

```
/harness-plan add input validation to the user registration endpoint
```

Harness will plan with 5-role review, apply a review gate, build, run 5-role code evaluation, auto-fix trivial issues, create bisectable commits, and open a PR — all without leaving your IDE.

### Updating

```bash
harness update          # upgrade to latest, reinstall agents, check config
harness update --check  # just check if a new version is available
```

---

## What happens under the hood

```
You type /harness-ship "add feature X"
  → Rebase onto main, run tests
  → 5-role code evaluation (all dispatched in parallel):
      Architect:       design + security review
      Product Owner:   completeness + behavior
      Engineer:        quality + performance
      QA:              regression + testing (only role running CI)
      Project Manager: scope + delivery
  → Fix-First: auto-fix trivial issues, ask about important ones
  → Bisectable commits + push + PR
```

### Unified 5-role review system

The same 5 specialized roles review both **plans** and **code**, dispatched in parallel:

| Role | Plan Review Focus | Code Eval Focus |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Architect** | Feasibility, module impact, dependency changes | Conformance, layering, coupling, security |
| **Product Owner** | Vision alignment, user value, acceptance criteria | Requirement coverage, behavioral correctness |
| **Engineer** | Implementation feasibility, code reuse, tech debt | Code quality, DRY, patterns, performance |
| **QA** | Test strategy, boundary values, regression risk | Test coverage, edge cases, CI health |
| **Project Manager** | Task decomposition, parallelism, scope | Scope drift, plan completion, delivery risk |

Findings from 2+ roles are flagged as **high confidence**. Each role can use a different model via `[native.role_models]` in `.agents/config.toml`.

### Fix-First auto-remediation

Review findings are classified before presenting:

- **AUTO-FIX** — High certainty, small blast radius, reversible. Fixed immediately and committed.
- **ASK** — Security findings, behavior changes, or low confidence. Presented to you for decision.

Trivial issues never block shipping. Important decisions always get human judgment.

### Graceful degradation

| Roles responding | Behavior |
|-----------------|----------|
| 5/5 | Full synthesis with cross-validation |
| 3-4/5 | Proceed with available reviews, note missing perspectives |
| 1-2/5 | Log warning, fall through to single-agent review |
| 0/5 | Fall back to single generalPurpose subagent |

## Configuration

Project settings live in `.agents/config.toml`:

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `workflow.mode` | "orchestrator" | `orchestrator` or `cursor-native` |
| `workflow.profile` | "standard" | `lite` / `standard` / `autonomous` |
| `workflow.max_iterations` | 3 | Max iterations per task |
| `workflow.pass_threshold` | 7.0 | Evaluator pass threshold (out of 10) |
| `workflow.auto_merge` | true | Auto-merge branch after pass |
| `workflow.dual_evaluation` | false | Add alignment review after quality review |
| `workflow.branch_prefix` | "agent" | Task branch prefix |
| `native.gate_full_review_min` | 5 | Escalation score for full human review |
| `native.gate_summary_confirm_min` | 3 | Escalation score for summary confirmation |
| `native.adversarial_model` | "gpt-4.1" | Cross-model reviewer model |
| `native.adversarial_mechanism` | "auto" | Adversarial dispatch mode. Allowed: `subagent`, `cli`, `auto` |
| `native.review_gate` | "eng" | Review gate strictness. Allowed: `eng` (hard gate), `advisory` (log only) |
| `native.plan_review_gate` | "auto" | Plan review gate mode. Allowed: `human` (always stop), `ai` (auto-approve), `auto` (complexity-adaptive) |
| `native.retro_window_days` | 14 | Default retro analysis window in days (1–365) |
| `native.role_models.*` | `{}` | Per-role model overrides. Keys: `architect`, `product_owner`, `engineer`, `qa`, `project_manager` |
| `autonomous.max_tasks_per_session` | 10 | Max tasks per autonomous session |
| `autonomous.consecutive_block_limit` | 2 | Stop after this many consecutive blocks |

### Models (optional)

Per-role model selection under `[models]`. Harness only passes `--model` when the resolved value is non-empty.

**Resolution order**: `role_overrides.<role>` → `driver_defaults.<driver>` → `models.default` → empty.

```toml
[models]
default = ""

[models.driver_defaults]
# codex = "o3"
# cursor = "claude-4-opus"

[models.role_overrides]
# planner = "o3-pro"
# builder = ""  # explicit: always use IDE default
```

### Workflow profiles

| Profile | Flow | When to use |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **lite** | planner → builder → eval (no spec/contract split; threshold cap 3.0; max 2 rounds) | Small changes, quick fixes |
| **standard** | planner → spec + contract → builder → eval (full review) | Day-to-day development (default) |
| **autonomous** | strategist → standard loop → reflector | Vision-driven autonomous mode |

## Task artifacts

All artifacts live under `.agents/` at the project root:

```
.agents/
├── config.toml            # Project config
├── vision.md              # Project vision
├── state.json             # Runtime state
├── .stop                  # Stop signal
├── runs/
│   └── <session-id>/
│       └── events.jsonl   # Structured events
├── tasks/
│   └── task-001/
│       ├── spec-r1.md     # Spec: analysis and technical plan
│       ├── contract-r1.md # Contract (Markdown)
│       ├── contract-r1.json # Contract (JSON sidecar)
│       ├── evaluation-r1.md # Review (Markdown)
│       ├── evaluation-r1.json # Review (JSON sidecar)
│       ├── alignment-r1.md # Alignment review (if dual_evaluation)
│       ├── build-r1.log   # Builder log
│       └── ...
└── archive/               # Archived sessions
```

Every step is traceable. JSON sidecars suit automation and UIs without regex-parsing Markdown.

**Local-first**: All state stays on disk; no cloud dependency. The `.agents/` tree is usually gitignored. To share `config.toml` or `vision.md` with your team, use `git add -f .agents/config.toml`.

## Advanced: Cross-Client Orchestrator Mode

Cursor-native mode covers most interactive development workflows. For **CI/CD pipelines**, **headless automation**, or **multi-IDE setups** (Cursor + Codex), use orchestrator mode.

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Requirement | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Python** | >= 3.9 | Runs the Harness CLI |
| **Cursor CLI and/or Codex CLI** | At least one | Provides agent capability |
| **Git** | Any version | Project must be a Git repo |

IDE CLI setup:

- **Cursor**: Command Palette → `Install 'cursor' command`
- **Codex**: `npm install -g @openai/codex` or from [GitHub](https://github.com/openai/codex)

### Orchestrator vs Cursor-native

|  | Orchestrator | Cursor-native |
|---|---|---|
| **How it runs** | External `harness` CLI spawns agent processes | Skills + subagents inside Cursor IDE |
| **Entry point** | `harness run` / `harness auto` | `/harness-brainstorm`, `/harness-vision`, `/harness-plan` |
| **Cross-model review** | Configurable per role | 5-role parallel reviewers with per-role model overrides (`native.role_models`) |
| **When to use** | CI/CD, headless, multi-IDE | Interactive development, Cursor-only |

### Role architecture

| Role | Responsibility | Default backend (`auto` mode) |
|------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Planner** | Analyze requirements; produce spec and contract | Codex |
| **Builder** | Implement against the contract; commit changes | Cursor |
| **Evaluator** | Independent review; four-dimensional scoring | Codex |
| **Alignment Evaluator** | Requirement alignment and intent drift detection | Codex |
| **Strategist** | Pick the next task from vision (autonomous mode) | Codex |
| **Reflector** | Distill lessons into long-term memory | Codex/Cursor |

Each role's backend is configurable under `[drivers.roles]`. See [docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md) for CLI version requirements.

### Orchestrator setup

```bash
# 1. Install agent definitions to IDE directories
harness install

# 2. Initialize (choose "orchestrator" mode)
cd /path/to/your/project
harness init

# 3. Create project vision
harness vision

# 4. Run
harness run "add user authentication"   # single task
harness auto                            # autonomous loop

# 5. Monitor
harness status
harness stop
```

### Single-task flow (`harness run`)

```
Requirement
  → Planner: spec + iterative contract
  → Builder: implement and commit
  → Evaluator: four-dimensional score
      → Pass (≥ 7.0) → done
      → Fail → feedback to Builder, iterate
  → Max iterations (3) → blocked
```

### Autonomous loop (`harness auto`)

```
Vision
  → Strategist: pick next task
  → Single-task flow
  → Reflector: distill lessons
  → Loop until: all done / stop signal / block limit / task limit
```

### Dual Evaluator

With `workflow.dual_evaluation = true`, quality review is followed by alignment review:

- **Quality** — Code quality + regression (four-dimensional scoring)
- **Alignment** — Requirement coverage + contract fit + intent drift

If alignment returns `MISALIGNED`, the task iterates back to Builder. If `CONTRACT_ISSUE`, feedback goes to Planner to revise the contract instead.

```toml
[workflow]
dual_evaluation = true
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Resuming interrupted work

```bash
harness run "original requirement" --resume
harness auto --resume
```

`--resume` reloads from `state.json` and continues from the interrupted phase.

### Stop behavior

`harness stop` writes `.agents/.stop`. The task finishes its current phase and exits cleanly. For immediate abort, use `Ctrl+C` — Harness saves a checkpoint before exit.

### IDE CLI not found

If you see `Neither Cursor nor Codex CLI detected`:

- **Cursor**: Command Palette → `Install 'cursor' command`
- **Codex**: `npm install -g @openai/codex`

Ensure the binary is on PATH. For cursor-native mode, Cursor CLI is optional — harness generates files that work directly in the IDE.

### Reinstalling

If `harness install` fails or produces a broken setup:

```bash
harness install --force
```

This overwrites existing files, retries CLI installations, and regenerates native artifacts.

---

## Observability

Each session writes structured events to `.agents/runs/<session-id>/events.jsonl`:

```json
{"ts": "2026-03-31T10:00:00.000Z", "event": "agent_end", "role": "planner", "driver": "codex", "exit_code": 0, "elapsed_ms": 12340}
```

Event types: `agent_start`/`agent_end`, `ci_result`, `state_transition`, `task_start`/`task_end`.

## When it fits — and when it doesn't

**Good fit:**

- You use Cursor and want quality gates on agent output, not blind trust
- You want traceability across multi-step work
- You want adversarial review to catch what a single pass misses

**Poor fit:**

- Expecting a one-click "build the whole product" autopilot
- Enterprise approval workflows unrelated to coding
- Environments where you cannot install Python or any supported agent CLI (Cursor/Codex)

---

## Internationalization

```bash
harness init --lang zh    # Chinese
harness init --lang en    # English (default)
```

Affects CLI messages, agent prompts, generated files, and installed agent definitions. Stored in `.agents/config.toml` under `[project] lang`.

---

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
ruff check src/ tests/
ruff format src/ tests/
```

Ruff targets Python 3.9 with line length 100. See [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md) for the release process.
